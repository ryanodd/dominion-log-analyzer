DECK DRAWING CONSISTENCY (AverageTurnPayload):
- just use monte carlo lol. Need to ensure that action-choosing is O(1)

ASSESSING LONG-TERM DECISIONS (trashing, gains):
- far lookahead?
- a far lookahead will usually involve more long-term decisions to make (exponential complexity boooooo)

Remember to consider the "How many times will I play this card before the game ends" paradigm

GAME LOG:
- A log would prooooobably be a good idea
- Outpost and Hermit rely on information from the past
  - miiiiight be able to get away with preparing this information in the gameState

REACTIONS (the Merchant problem):
- When you play a Merchant, there is suddenly a listener in the game (the effect is NOT tied to the card)
- For example if you Throne Room a Merchant, there are 2 listeners and 1 Merchant
- Therefore the gameState needs to hold information about these listeners.
- Listeners can be functions which are called when certain events occur
- These listeners can be added to the "listener queue"
- whose order is controlled by the player who controls the effect? Dominion Online uses this, what are the rules

ATTACKS:
- Plan: every attack has its own separate function that is referenced in the card steps.
  - the attacks go through an attack interface (always every other player?)
  - this lets others react to the attack and potentially cancel it
    - this "cancellable" event should also apply to gains because of Trader

VP / GAME END:
