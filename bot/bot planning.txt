Terminal crashes: has to account for drawing, villages.
- chances of a specific card being the turn's terminal? (e.g. even if a smithy draws another action, it was terminal. no actions left)
- chances of a specific card NOT being possible to play (due to lacking actions)
- in this algorithm, cards with [1 action, 1 card] should be equivalent to not being in the deck
- cards with +2 actions (or more) should lower the chances of a terminal crash somehow.

Assess the value of things that don't immediately improve the deck (e.g. moneylender)

assessing the value of a gain (workshop is not as good as gaining 4 money)

For things that depend on deck size, calculate expected deck sizes throughout the game based on buys, gains
- notably assessing how many times you think a card will played in the future (for assessing moneylender value)

attacks

alternate vp approaches

Choices:
- Card/Cards/Nothing from hand/deck/discard
- Card Action Choice
- Gain up to X
- Gain costing X (to opponent)
- Card/Cards/Nothing in temp storage of some sort (e.g. look at the top 2 cards of your deck)
- Y/N Deny Attack
- Name a Card (Wishing Well)
- Position in deck to put new card (n+1 choices)
- "May"s (always allow response of -1? Are all responses by index? What about wishing well)
- Choosing order of cards (1 by 1 answer indexes without replacement?)
